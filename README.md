# How-to-Maintain-Healthy-Birthweight

Based on the data studied, recommendations can be made to women on how to give birth to a healthier baby with a healthy weight:

- <em>Bad habits.</em><br>
  Try to get rid of bad habits - cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. Consuming on average only two cigarettes a day and one drink during 
  pregnancy will result in 190 grams of weight loss for the baby. Moreover, if you are a white woman and the child's father is also white, 
  an additional 10 grams should be taken away. The same is true for other races, for example, Latino -6 grams.

- <em>Prenatal Visits.</em><br>
  Try to attend prenatal visits at least once every 6 weeks, but not more often than once every 3 weeks. This should be done only if 
  indicated by a doctor! Otherwise, try not to get nervous before attending another unscheduled prenatal visit.

- <em>Age.</em><br>
  If a woman is 42 years old, try to be more attentive to health since your fertility significantly decreases from this period. The next 
  turning point will be 49 years old when the risks of having an unhealthy baby are high enough.

- <em>Education.</em><br>
  If you live in a black family, better quality and continuing education will increase the risks for healthy childbirth due to a more 
  responsible lifestyle.
